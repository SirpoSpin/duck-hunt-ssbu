          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Canicide is the act of using the explosion from Trick Shot's Can to launch you and your opponent into an advantageous or mixup situation. 
            <br><br>If you are on the lower end of a near percent difference between you and your opponent (ideally ~20%) and are launched by the Can's explosion in the same direction, you can sometimes get a follow-up attack in before your opponent can react. This is sometimes referred to as a Canicide Combo, though it is not often true. 
            <br><br>Canicide can also be used as a means to 'gimp' your opponent's offstage recovery in the air or below ledge, an effective option when you can't quickly send the can to such a position or are aiming to net a KO with a Canicide Combo.
            <br><br>Despite the damage cost and risk of a reversal, the technique is a relatively reliable means of securing KOs.
          </p>

          <h2>Opponent Counterplay</h2>
          <p>
            Offstage Canicide can be a threat if you play as a character with a weak, low recovery that would cause you to get 'gimped' by the blast.
            <br><br>Canicide Combos become a threat when you and your opponent have relatively close percentage ranges, approximately 20% depending on launch mathematics. 
            <br><br>Whoever is on the lower side of this percentage difference will generally be in the more advantageous sitation for a followup attack that could result in a KO.
            <br><br>Accordingly, you could bait your opponent to frame 1 escape from a combo if you are aware of the approximate percentage difference you will have at the moment, then followup with a ring-out attack.
            <br><br>The Can's launch angle is in the ballpark of 45 degrees in the direction that the opponents in contact are from the can.
