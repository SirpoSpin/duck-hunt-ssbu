            <h3>Anchor Can</h3>
            <p>
            Anchor Can is a state in which the Can is 'fixed' to a position and immune from being moved by projectiles. 
            If the opponent hits Can and takes 'ownership', the Can will take no further knockback from any of their projectiles. 
            The Can will remain in this state until you take back ownership, i.e. by hitting or pinging it. See [Anchor Can] for more details.
            </p>

            <h3>Can</h3>
            <p>
            The projectile used in Duck Hunt's Neutral Special, Trick Shot.
        </p>

            <h3>Canicide</h3>
            <p>
            The act of using the explosion from <Can> to launch both yourself and your opponent. See <a href="/duck-hunt-ssbu/doc/technique/canicide.html">Canicide</a> for more details.
            </p>
            <h3>Can Ownership</h3>
            <p>
            The last player to hit a Can (including with a projectile) “owns” it. Any player can take ownership by hitting the Can, including with Duck Hunt's Ping.
            Can Ownership affects several properties of the can, e.g. an airborne or overheated Can will not explode when it touches its current owner. 
            See [Can Ownership] for more details.
            </p>
            <h3>Can Parry</h3>
            <p>
            If you ping Can while it is hit with attack (whether yours or your opponent's), the Can will ignore the knockback and continue its normal arc. 
            In this state, the knockback is ignored and 'stored' for later. Duck Hunt's own moves can be Can Parried as well.
            Not to be confused with the act of parrying the can's hitbox.
            See [Knockback Storage] for more details.
            </p>
            <h3>Clay Pigeon</h3>
            <p>
            The projectile created by Duck Hunt's Side Special, Clay Shooting. 
        </p>
        <h3>Clay Shooting</h3>
        <p>
            Duck Hunt's Side Special, responsible for spawning and detonating Clay Pigeon.
        </p>
    <h3>Frisbee</h3>
        <p>
            Colloquial term for Clay Pigeon.
        </p>
        <h3>Hangman</h3>
        <p>
            A glitch that causes Duck Hunt to stall in the air while spawning Wild Gunmen. 
            The glitch performed on the Angel Platform by activating Wild Gunman within a single frame, then repeating the process using the buffer system.
            See <Glitches> for more information.
            </p>
            <h3>Knockback Storage</h3>
            <p>
            If the Can ignores the knockback of an attack (i.e. through [Can Parrying] or [Anchor Can]), it remembers (stores) the knockback of that move. 
            The next time it is hit by a non-projectile, instead of taking that attack's knockback, it will release the stored knockback. 
            See [Knockback Storage] for more details.
            </p>
            <h3>Lucina Slayer</h3>
            <p>
            See [Marth Slayer].
            </p>
            <h3>Marth Slayer</h3>
            <p>
            Using [Shield Can] while next to the ledge to punish recoveries with hitboxes that extend past the floor before snapping ledge, such as Marth/Lucina's Up Specials. This could take the opponent's stock at extra high percentages.
            </p>
            <h3>Perfect Can Parry</h3>
            <p>
            [Can Parrying] a move on the exact same frame that the move hits Can. Unlike regular Can Parry, the attacker does not take ownership of the Can, so the Can will explode if it lands on them.
            </p>
            <h3>Pigeon Chain</h3>
            The act of comboing a Clay Pigeon attack into subsequent Clay Pigeon attack(s).
        </p>
        <h3>Ping</h3>
        <p>
            The gunshot from Duck Hunt's Neutral Special that makes Can do a small jump. Additionally, the shots from Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks and Side Special 'ping' Can in a similar manner to Neutral Special, instead of dealing their usual knockback.
        </p>
        <h3>Pingas</h3>
        <p>
            An infamous patched-out glitch that resulted in the ping reticle 'doubling' on Duck Hunt's Smash Attacks if activated at the same time a Smash Attack reticle appeared.
            This would effectively double the damage per hit and occasionally cause other glitches.
            See [Glitches] for more information.
            </p>
            <h3>Shield Can</h3>
            <p>
            The act of shielding in close proximity to Can such that the can's explosion hitbox will overlap with your shield. 
            If the opponent hits the Can, it will instantly explode on your protective Shield and hit them if they are close enough.
        </p>
        <h3>Sticky Can</h3>
        <p>
            Pinging Can into the wall or underside of the stage so it stalls around the ledge. This can catch recoveries or even 2-frame. 
            Most effective against recovery moves with no hitboxes, especially tether recoveries.
        </p>
        <h3>Stored Knockback</h3>
        <p>
            See [Knockback Storage]
            </p>
            <h3>Updog</h3>
            <p>
            The combo of Down Throw into Up Air. It is true at high percentages and potentially a kill confirm, but Up Air only connects if the opponent DIs in after the Down Throw.
            </p>
            <h3>Wild Gunman</h3> 
            <p>
            Duck Hunt's Down Special. Summons one of five bagged-random Gunmen that absorb some damage and fire a thin, long horizonal projectile after a Gunman-specific timing.
